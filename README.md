# Chaino – Arduino I2C/Serial Function Execution Library

**Chaino** is an Arduino-compatible library that enables devices to call each other’s functions via **Serial** or **I2C** communication, pass arguments, and receive return values.  
It supports both **Master ↔ Slave** and local function execution, allowing you to register and execute functions easily with a unified API.
